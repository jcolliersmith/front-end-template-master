## Description
```
Our Bucket List of Photos is a website that will be used to keep track of our bucket list via photos from the experiences. Hopefully this will also provide inspiration for those viewing to create thier own sense of adventure.

```
## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1.  <div class="container">
This class is used to contain elements in their own space

2.  <div class="banner">
A class I created to have a banner on the homepage

3.  <footer class="main-footer">
Created to maintain footer on all pages

4.  <ul class="main-nav">
Created for main navigation structure

5.  <div class="lightbox-gallery">
Used to add depth to photos page. The lightbox opens when you click on the image showing you the image a bit bigger. When you are viewing this in a smaller size the text shows up explaining what the image is. The lightbox goes away when you click on the image once again. 


```
## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. (function() {
    var $lightbox = $("<div class='lightbox'></div>");
    var $img = $("<img>");
    var $caption = $("<p class='caption'></p>");function name ex( animate() )
    This is used to create a lightbox around images in photos. When you click on the image the lightbox appears and shows the image a bit bigger. On a smaller responsive size, text shows up underneath the image to explain what the picture is. This feature is responsive. When you click on the image again the lightbox closes. 

```
